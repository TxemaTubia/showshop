# showshop
This is the skeleton or even a little less of the skeleton of a webshop made with django

Note for evaluator: In the case you are thinking why, in the year of the lord of 2020, I'm using Django 1.11, and not 3.0. Well, I had some troubles with the virtualenviroment of the machine a used to create this project.

First of all, is not a complete project at all, is just the beginnin but... I'm running out of time. I most apologize. Modules to manage emails and cvs files are not added, also the specific restful API to manage data models are not included. This is just the first step of the project, you can see the first data model aproach and it can be viwed in the models itself or in the SQLITE3 database, wich is automatically generated by DJANGO and includes the models I've done.

Feel free to download, change, laught, scream or ignore all this code.

Sincerly yours,
Txema
